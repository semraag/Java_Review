Week07 Review:
	Array
	For Each Loop
	Multi-Dimensional Array
	ArrayList
	Array vs ArrayList



Data Structure: to store multiple elements.
				to use data efficiently

				Array, Collection, Map

Array: Supports both primitives & non-primitives data types.
		Can be multi-dimensional
		Size is fixed
		Faster

	Single dimensional array: to store elements. A container for storing multiple element

	multi-dimensional array: to store arrays. A container for storing multiple arrays


For Each Loop: A loop that's already been iterated

			total number of iteration and order of iteration are fixed

			MUST HAVE A DATA STRUCTURE

			Remove Methods:
				remove(): When we need to remove one single element ONLY.
							DO NOT USE IT WHEN LOOPING THROUGH A COLLECTION

				removeAll(): WHen we need to remove multiple elements & the elements are known in advance

				clear(): When we need to remove all the elements

				retainAll(): WHen we need to keep specific elements and remove the rest

				removeIf(): When we need to remove elements under conditions


ArrayList: Supports non-primitive types ONLY
			Can not be multi-dimensional
			Size is dynamic (growable in nature)



Tasks:
Write a program that can remove string elements from an arraylist if the first and last characters of the string are same
    ex:
        list = {"Anna", "Canada", "Bob", "David", "Lan", "Abida", "Ebrahim", "Farida"}

    output:
        ["Canada", "Lan", "Ebrahim", "Farida"]


Write a program that can return the nth largest number from an arraylist
            ex:
                arraylist = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,7,8,8}
                n = 3

            output:
                6
